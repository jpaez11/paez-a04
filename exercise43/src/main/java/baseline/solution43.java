    Pseudocode:
    websites are pretty cool, let's try and write one
    but this one will prompt the user to:
    give a name for the site
    ask who the author is
    ask user if they want a folder for either JavaScript or CSS files
    and generate an index.html that contains the name of the site
    inside the <title> tag and the author in a <meta> tag
